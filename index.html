            <h2>Every idea starts with a need</h2>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

            <h4>Start with asking </h4>
            <p> You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of achieving goals.</p>
            <h4>Your ideas will have more value </h4>
            <p>By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.</p>
            <h4>Design solutions with love </h4>
            <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.<p>
            <h4>Share and show your work </h4>
            <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
